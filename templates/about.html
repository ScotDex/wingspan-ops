                Welcome to the <strong>Wingspan Data Hub</strong> (it needs a better name, suggestions in the feedback form!). Fully developed and reconstructed by <a href="https://zkillboard.com/character/95282689/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:underline">Dexomus Viliana</a> as how previous IT guys made stuff then ghosted everyone annoyed me. The site is still under active development, but I have managed to regain most of the features of the classic "Short Circuit" tool.

                The original infrastructure was getting a bit old, getting slower and more fragile that Zeratule responding to DM's. The goal was simple: redevelop its functionality into something fast, clean, and less likely to break.
            </p>
            
            <h3>What Can It Actually Do?</h3>
            <p>Well it looks kinda pretty, but it can actually do stuff also.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Live Wormhole Connections:</strong> See a real-time list of all known wormhole connections, so you can stop face-checking that C2 with a 2 billion ISK Loki.</li>
                <li><strong>Agent Leaderboard:</strong> A little friendly competition never hurt anyone. This board tracks agent scan counts, giving you a valid reason to resent your corpmates.</li>
                <li><strong>Character Lookup:</strong> Spell the name right and you'll never have to google someone again.</li>
                <li><strong>Route Planner ("Short Circuit"):</strong> Find the quickest path from A to B through the tangled web of wormhole space. It's like a GPS for people who enjoy the constant threat of being vaporized by Sleepers.</li>
            </ul>

                    <h4 class="font-semibold">Is the data up to date?</h4>
                    <p>Mostly. The wormhole connection data from our agents is real-time. Data from EVE-Scout and ESI (like kills) is updated every few minutes. So, it's fresh enough that it won't get you killed. Probably.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4 class="font-semibold">How is this different from Tripwire?</h4>
                    <p>Think of this as a high-level strategic map, while Tripwire is your detailed, in-the-moment operational tool. This hub gives you the "big picture" of the wormhole network, while Tripwire is for tracking the chain you're actively in. They work best together.</p>

                <div>
                    <h4 class="font-semibold">I found a bug / I have a great idea for a feature!</h4>
                    <p>Excellent! Please use the "Submit Feedback" link in the sidebar. All suggestions and bug reports are welcome, especially the ones that make me question my life choices.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-8">Acknowledgements & The Future</h3>
            <p>
                A massive thank you goes out to <strong>EVE-Scout</strong>; their public Thera connections API makes this tool significantly more useful. You can check it out <a href="https://api.eve-scout.com/ui/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:underline">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                More features are in the pipeline. Stay tuned.
            </p>
