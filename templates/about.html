                Welcome to the <strong>Wingspan Data Hub</strong>(it needs a better name, suggestions in the feedback form!). This is essentially what happens when I see something old and decrepid and want to do some good <a href="https://zkillboard.com/character/95282689/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:underline">Dexomus Viliana</a>, so its still under testing and development but we have regained most of the features of short circuit.
            </p>
            <p>
                The original infrastructure was getting a bit old, creaking under the weight of a decade of internet dust. The goal was simple: redevelop its functionality into something fast, clean, and less likely to break than a promise in Jita.
            </p>
            
            <h3>What Can It Actually Do?</h3>
            <p>It's not just a pretty face. Hereâ€™s the toolkit at your disposal:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Live Wormhole Connections:</strong> See a real-time list of all known wormhole connections, so you can stop face-checking that C2 with a 2 billion ISK Loki.</li>
                <li><strong>Agent Leaderboard:</strong> A little friendly competition never hurt anyone. This board tracks agent scan counts, giving you a valid reason to resent your corpmates.</li>
                <li><strong>Character Lookup:</strong> Spell the name right and you'll never have to google someone again.</li>
                <li><strong>Route Planner ("Short Circuit"):</strong> Find the quickest path from A to B through the tangled web of wormhole space. It's like a GPS for people who enjoy the constant threat of being vaporized by Sleepers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Acknowledgements & The Future</h3>
            <p>
                A massive thank you goes out to <strong>EVE-Scout</strong>; their public Thera connections API as it makes things a little more rich. You can check it out <a href="https://api.eve-scout.com/ui/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:underline">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                More features are in the pipeline. Stay tuned.
