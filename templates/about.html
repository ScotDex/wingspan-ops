                Welcome to the <strong>Wingspan Data Hub</strong>. Essentially, this is what happens when a Go programmer looks at an old, beloved, but slightly dusty Python app and says, "You know, I could probably rebuild this." ðŸš€

                This whole project started as a replacement for the classic "Short Circuit" tool. Why? Mostly because staring into the abyss of decade-old code is a special kind of horror, and I wanted a tool that was fast, clean, and didn't creak like my spine.

            <h3>What Can It Actually Do?</h3>
            <p>Good question. It's not just a pretty face. Hereâ€™s the toolkit at your disposal:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Live Wormhole Connections:</strong> See a real-time list of all known wormhole connections. Stop guessing and start knowing exactly where that C2 leads without having to face-check it with a 2 billion Loki (soon)</li>
                <li><strong>Agent Leaderboard:</strong> A little friendly competition never hurt anyone. This board tracks agent scan counts, giving you reason to hate each other</li>
                <li><strong>Route Planner:</strong> Find the quickest path from A to B through the tangled web of wormhole space. It's like a GPS for people who enjoy the constant threat of being vaporized by sleepers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The goal is simple: modernize and not have an infrastructure thats slower than Zeratul responding to DM's
